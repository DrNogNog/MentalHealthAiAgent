"# Working on creating a therapist based on a book" 
# This is in development, it should use langgraph to access your emails and mistral ocr to access a book pdf on depressive disorders to extract into text for prompt generation
# in each of the nodes of the langgraph
# we should then do data analysis work with tabeleau on growing depression amongst people and in certain areas.
# The backend folder contains all LLM calls,
# while the front end is everything else, please use npm run dev
